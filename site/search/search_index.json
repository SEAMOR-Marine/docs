Introduction This document outlines communication requirements for use of SEAMOR Sturgeon 200 Thruster. This communication protocol is based on MODBUS over RS-485. MODBUS based debugging tools and resources can be used for testing and validation, but no guarantee is made by SEAMOR for full compatibility with existing MODBUS devices or libraries. Terminology consistent with MODBUS standards is used throughout this document. Please refer to https://www.modbus.org/specs.php for more details. 1.1 Node Types 1.1.1 Client The client is the network device that initiates all communication, typically a processor that will also communicate on other networks. Important Only one Client is allowed per network Note Client is referred to as Master in Legacy MODBUS documentation 1.1.1 Server A Server is a network device that responds to requests from a Client. Typically end node devices on the network. Important Maximum 63 Servers on a network Note Server is referred to as Slave in Legacy MODBUS documentation. Slave ID is used in this document to identify Servers. 2. Network Requirements 2.1 Communication Port settings Baud Rate 115200 Start Bit 1 Stop Bit 1 Parity Bit None 2.2 Message Gap Minimum 20 ms required between messages on the network (received or transmitted). 2.3 Timeout Any controllable action (eg. thruster rotation) will be maintained for a maximum of 1 second after successful message receipt. After timeout expiry the device will stop actions until the next valid command is recieved. 3. Message Types 3.1 Request/ Response 3.1.1 Frame Layouts 3.1.1.1 Client - Read Request Byte # 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Name Slave ID Function ID Register Address MSB Register Address LSB # Registers MSB # Registers LSB CRC LSB CRC MSB 3.1.1.2 Server - Read Reponse Byte # 1 2 3 4 5 ... n-1 n Name Slave ID Function ID # Bytes Read Data MSB x Data LSB x ... CRC LSB CRC MSB 3.1.1.3 Client - Write Request Byte # 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Name Slave ID Function ID Register Address MSB Register Address LSB Data MSB Data LSB CRC LSB CRC MSB 3.1.1.4 Server - Write Response Byte # 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Name Slave ID Function ID Register Address MSB Register Address LSB Data MSB Data LSB CRC LSB CRC MSB 3.1.2 Byte Definitions 3.1.2.1 Slave ID The unique 8-bit identifier for individual Servers. The configured device identifier valid in range of 0x01-0x3F (0x40-0xFE invalid, 0xFF indicates unconfigured). Slave ID 0x00 is reserved to indicate Broadcast Message (See Client Broadcast Definition). Important The default Slave ID is 0xFF before receiving a Write Request setting the Slave ID. 3.1.2.2 Function ID The unique 8-bit identifier to represent operation requested of the Server. Description ID code Read Read/Write Register 0x03 Read Read-only Register 0x04 Write Read/Write Register 0x06 Note Other MODBUS Function IDs are not supported. 3.1.2.3 Register Address The 16-bit register address for target operation, offset from database start register. Split into Most Significant Byte (MSB) and Least Significant Byte (LSB). 3.1.2.4 Number Of Registers The 16-bit value representing the number of registers in read request operation. Split into Most Significant Byte (MSB) and Least Significant Byte (LSB). 3.1.2.5 Number of Bytes Read The 8-bit value representing number of bytes returned. Note Each register contains 2 bytes 3.1.2.6 Data The 16-bit contents read from, or to be writtten into, target register. Split into Most Significant Byte (MSB) and Least Significant Byte (LSB). Note Read requests of greater than 1 register start at requested address 3.1.2.7 CRC The 16-bit Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) value of frame. Split into Most Significant Byte (MSB) and Least Significant Byte (LSB). Standard MODBUS CRC-16-ANSI (CRC-16-IBM) is used with algebraic polynomial 0xA001 (reverse of 0x8005). Important Sent in standard MODBUS little-endian format (CRC LSB first, CRC MSB second) 3.2 Client Broadcast Broadcast Messaging allows for simultaneous communication with all Servers on the network. Note Servers do not respond to Broadcast Messages Important The maximum Broadcast Message length is 24 bytes 3.2.1 Frame Layout Byte # 1 2 3 4 5 6-22 n-1 n Name Slave ID Function ID Register Address MSB Register Address LSB Broadcast ID Data Payload CRC LSB CRC MSB 3.2.2 Byte Definitions 3.2.2.1 Slave ID The unique 8-bit identifier for individual Servers, configured device identifier valid in range of 0x01-0x3F (0x40-0xFE invalid, 0xFF indicates unconfigured). Note Byte 1 in the frame is Slave ID 0x00 indicating a Broadcast Message, all other Slave ID used in frame refer to specific Server 3.2.2.2 Function ID The unique 8-bit identifier to represent operation requested of the Server. Important Only supported Broadcast Message function code is Write Read/Write Register: 0x06 3.2.2.3 Register Address The 16-bit register address for target operation, offset from the database start register. Split into Most Significant Byte (MSB) and Least Significant Byte (LSB). 3.2.2.4 Broadcast ID The unique 8-bit identifier to indicate frame structure. Note Currently only Broadcast ID 0x01 is supported 3.2.2.5 Data Payload The number of bytes and function specific to Broadcast ID (See Broadcast Payload Structure Definition) 3.2.2.6 CRC The 16-bit Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) value of frame. Split into Most Significant Byte (MSB) and Least Significant Byte (LSB). Standard MODBUS CRC-16-ANSI (CRC-16-IBM) is used with algebraic polynomial 0xA001 (reverse of 0x8005). Important Sent in standard MODBUS little-endian format (CRC LSB first, CRC MSB second) 3.2.3 Broadcast Payload Structure 3.2.3.1 Broadcast ID 0x01 Used to broadcast direction and duty cycle to multiple Servers. Valid for 1-8 Servers simultaneously (maximum data payload 3-17 bytes). Note Variable frame lengths are supported Data Payload Byte # 1 2 3 4 5 ... 16 17 Name Payload # Bytes Payload Byte 1A Payload Byte 1B Payload Byte 2A Payload Byte 2B ...
